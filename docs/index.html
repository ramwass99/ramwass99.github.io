          King Lear of Britain in an attempt to avoid unrest divides his kingdom
          between his three daughters, each portion depending on their
          declaration of loyalty for him. His elder two Reagan and Goneril
          succeed in his affections by their hypocritical declarations of love.
          However Cordelia the youngest is unable to do so and is banished by
          Lear. Cordelia goes on to marry the King of France.

        <p>
          King Lear gradually sinks into manic depression at the indifferent
          attitude of his two elder daughters’ towards him. In a tragic twist
          both daughters end up dead as a result of their feuding over the
          affections of Edmund the bastard son of Gloucester. Edmund in his bid
          to take over his brother’s property imprisons Lear and executes
          Cordelia. Lear dies soon after out of remorse.
