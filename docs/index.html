                <p>King Lear of Britain in an attempt to avoid unrest divides his kingdom between his three daughters, each portion depending on their declaration of loyalty for him. His elder two Reagan and Goneril succeed in his affections by their hypocritical declarations of love. However Cordelia the youngest is unable to do so and is banished by Lear. Cordelia goes on to marry the King of France.</p>

                <p>King Lear gradually sinks into manic depression at the indifferent attitude of his two elder daughters towards him.  In a tragic twist both daughters end up dead as a result of their feuding over the affections of Edmund the bastard son of Gloucester. Edmund in his bid to take over his brothers property imprisons Lear and executes Cordelia. Lear dies soon after out of remorse.</p>
