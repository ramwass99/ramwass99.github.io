If our father would sleep till I wak’d him, you should enjoy half his revenue for ever, and live the beloved of your brother, ‘EDGAR.’ Hum! Conspiracy? ‘Sleep till I wak’d him, you should enjoy half his revenue.’ My son Edgar! Had he a hand to write this? a heart and brain to breed it in? When came this to you? Who brought it? </p>

			<p class="speechaftercharacter"><span class="character_beforespeech">Lear&#9;</span>Ha! Goneril with a white beard? They flatter’d me like a dog, and told me I had white hairs in my beard ere the black ones were there. To say ‘ay’ and ‘no’ to everything I said! ‘Ay’ and </p>
			<p class="prose">‘no’ too was no good divinity. When the rain came to wet me once, and the wind to make me chatter; when the thunder would not peace at my bidding; there I found ‘em, there I smelt ‘em out. Go to, they are not men o’ their words! They told me I was everything. ‘Tis a lie-I am not ague-proof</p>
			<p class="speechaftercharacter"><span class="character_beforespeech">Gloucester&#9;</span>The trick of that voice I do well remember</p>

			<p class="verseline">When I do stare, see how the subject quakes</p>
			<p class="verseline">I pardon that man’s life. What was thy cause? </p>
			<p class="verseline">Adultery? </p>
			<p class="verseline">Thou shalt not die. Die for adultery? No</p>
			<p class="verseline">The wren goes to’t, and the small gilded fly </p>
			<p class="verseline">Does lecher in my sight</p>
			<p class="verseline">Let copulation thrive; for Gloucester’s bastard son </p>

			<p class="speechaftercharacter"><span class="character_beforespeech">Lear&#9;</span>What, art mad? A man may see how the world goes with no eyes</p>
			<p class="prose">Look with thine ears. See how yond justice rails upon yond simple thief. Hark in thine ear. Change places and, handy-dandy, which is the justice, which is the thief? Thou hast seen a farmer’s dog bark at a beggar? </p>

			<p class="verseline">Why dost thou lash that whore? Strip thine own back</p>
			<p class="verseline">Thou hotly lusts to use her in that kind </p>
